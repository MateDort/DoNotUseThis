Idea:
A web app students can use during class. It listens to what the teacher says and detects questions if question detected it answers the question using the transcript or if trtanscript does not mention it, it uses its own llm knowledge or google to answer. it also has a chat so student can chat with it asking questions. 

tech:
fill this up I was thinking React but i let use choose for transcribe we can use openai whisper. LLm fallbck can be gemini and fallback openai

UI:
colors:
- light blue and baige

Start scrreeen:
simple start button and maybe some text and animations on whhow it works 

at it is and record screen:
on teh top it shows the recording is going with red button flashing and the minutes and seconds its been recording for. the whole screen is like a chatbot when answer detected it appears on the users side as question from teacher: and answer from ll on the llm side if user asks a queion it just appears as normal without question from teacher:
